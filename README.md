# birdbrains files
The `turdus_migratorius_model.ipynb` file is the main code for the project, with the final model we used, visual plots, maps, api calls, statistics, etc. 

The `world_cells.ipynb` file includes the plot for the H3 cells (geospatial groupings) with bird density, along with a couple other non-essential exploratory code.

Files for analyses of other birds, data filtering/cleaning, etc. can be provided upon request.
